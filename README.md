**I don't recommend that you use any of these files as is. None of them will probably work for you in their current state. Some of them have been heavily modified to fit my needs, and may change as those needs evolve. That being said, these are mainly for me to use, however feel free to explore and see all the hacky things I've done to make everything work.**
